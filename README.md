Customized installation of ICA-AtoM 1.3 for this project

The standard installation of ICA-AtoM 1.3 is used (currently out of service, replaced by AtoM 2.x)
After that the ICA installation has been customized in two ways:
- connection to the DASA repo by an additional EXPORT button, that creates EAD and puts it in the REPO
- the EAD converter is optimized to improve generation of a few data fields in the resulting EAD-XML datafile
